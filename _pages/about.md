Welcome
 ----
I am a physicist and a material scientist by profession. I have been working on materials modeling for more than 5 years. I am interested in understanding structure-property relationship based on computational methods including Density Functional Theory and beyond. I have been investigating electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials for various technological applications including energy storage, electronic, optical, and functional devices.
